# MKB-winstvrijstelling (SME Profit Exemption)

## Summary

The **MKB-winstvrijstelling** (Midden- en KleinBedrijf winstvrijstelling) is a tax exemption that makes **13.31% of your business profit tax-free**. It applies automatically to entrepreneurs and is one of the most valuable tax benefits for self-employed individuals in the Netherlands.

## Key Details

### Exemption Rate
- **13.31%** of business profit is tax-free (2024 and 2025)

### Eligibility
- ✅ Automatic - no application needed
- ✅ Applies to all entrepreneurs (ZZP, sole proprietors, partnerships)
- ✅ No requirements or conditions
- ✅ Works with profit after other deductions

### Does NOT Apply To
- ❌ BV (corporation) profits
- ❌ Employment income
- ❌ Investment income (Box 2/3)

## Calculation Example

### Simple Example

Business profit: €50,000

```
Gross profit: €50,000
MKB-winstvrijstelling (13.31%): -€6,655
Taxable profit: €43,345

Tax saved: €6,655 × 36.97% = €2,460
(or €3,296 if in 49.50% bracket)
```

### Combined with Other Deductions

Business profit: €60,000

```
Gross profit: €60,000

Step 1: Apply zelfstandigenaftrek
€60,000 - €3,750 = €56,250

Step 2: Apply MKB-winstvrijstelling (on original profit!)
€60,000 × 13.31% = €7,986

Final taxable profit: €60,000 - €3,750 - €7,986 = €48,264

Total tax benefit:
- Zelfstandigenaftrek: €3,750 × 36.97% = €1,386
- MKB-vrijstelling: €7,986 × 36.97% = €2,952
- Combined savings: €4,338
```

## Important Notes

### Based on Profit, Not Revenue

The exemption applies to **net profit** (winst), not turnover:

```
Revenue: €100,000
Expenses: -€40,000
Net profit: €60,000

MKB exemption: 13.31% × €60,000 = €7,986
```

### Applies Before Other Deductions

The 13.31% is calculated on profit **before** other deductions like zelfstandigenaftrek:

```
Profit: €50,000

MKB percentage based on: €50,000 (not reduced amount)
Exemption: €50,000 × 13.31% = €6,655

Then subtract from profit:
€50,000 - €6,655 = €43,345
```

### Works with Negative Profit

If you make a loss:
- MKB exemption doesn't apply (can't exempt a loss)
- Loss can offset other Box 1 income
- Loss can be carried forward to future years

## Comparison: ZZP vs BV

One reason many entrepreneurs stay ZZP (sole proprietor) rather than forming a BV:

### ZZP Benefits
```
Profit: €60,000
After MKB (13.31%): €51,986 taxable
After zelfstandigenaftrek: €48,236 taxable
Box 1 tax @ 36.97%: €17,833
Net: €42,167
```

### BV (Simplified)
```
Profit: €60,000
Corporate tax (19%): €11,400
Remaining: €48,600
Dividend tax (26.9%): €13,073
Net: €35,527
```

**Difference**: ~€6,640 more as ZZP in this example

(Note: BV has other benefits like pension, liability protection)
