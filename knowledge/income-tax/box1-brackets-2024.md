# Income Tax Brackets (Box 1) 2024

## Effective Tax Rate

Due to progressive brackets and credits, effective rate is lower than marginal rate:

|--------------|-----|---------|---------|----------------|
| €30,000 | €11,091 | €5,848 | €5,243 | 17.5% |

| €75,000 | €27,729 | €6,078 | €21,651 | 28.9% |
| €100,000 | €36,843 | €3,817 | €33,026 | 33.0% |

## 30% Ruling

For qualifying expats:
- 30% of salary considered tax-free reimbursement
- Applied to gross salary
- Significantly reduces tax burden
- Valid for up to 5 years
- Strict eligibility requirements

### Example with 30% Ruling

€90,000 salary:
```
Taxable: 70% × €90,000 = €63,000
Non-taxable: 30% × €90,000 = €27,000

Tax on €63,000 ≈ €18,000 (vs €35,000 without ruling)
```
