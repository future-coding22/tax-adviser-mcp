# BTW (VAT) Filing Deadlines and Requirements

## Summary

BTW (Belasting over de Toegevoegde Waarde) is Dutch VAT. Self-employed individuals and businesses must file BTW returns quarterly, monthly, or annually depending on turnover and registration.

## BTW Rates (2024)

| Rate Type | Percentage | Applies To |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Standard** (Algemeen tarief) | **21%** | Most goods and services |
| **Reduced** (Verlaagd tarief) | **9%** | Food, books, medicine, public transport |
| **Zero** | **0%** | Exports outside EU, certain international services |

## Filing Frequency

Your filing frequency depends on your turnover:

### Quarterly (Most Common)
- **Who**: Most small businesses and freelancers
- **Deadlines**: End of month **following** the quarter
  - Q1 (Jan-Mar): Deadline **April 30**
  - Q2 (Apr-Jun): Deadline **July 31**
  - Q3 (Jul-Sep): Deadline **October 31**
  - Q4 (Oct-Dec): Deadline **January 31** (next year)

### Monthly
- **Who**: Businesses with high turnover or who request monthly filing
- **Deadline**: End of month following the month
  - Example: January BTW due by **February 28**

### Annually
- **Who**: Very small businesses (under certain thresholds)
- **Deadline**: March 31 of following year

## Small Business Exemption (KOR)

### Kleine Ondernemers Regeling (KOR)

If your annual turnover is below **€25,000**:
- You can apply for KOR exemption
- **No BTW charged** to customers
- **No BTW deducted** on expenses
- **No BTW returns** required
- Simpler administration

⚠️ **Considerations:**
- Can't reclaim BTW on business expenses (computers, equipment, etc.)
- Might appear less professional to B2B clients
- Can't compete on price with BTW-registered competitors
- Must monitor turnover - exceeding €25,000 requires re-registration

## How to File

### Online Filing (Required)

All BTW returns must be filed electronically:

1. **Via Belastingdienst Zakelijk**:
   - Log in with DigiD or eHerkenning
   - Navigate to "BTW aangifte doen"
   - Enter amounts and submit

2. **Via Accounting Software**:
   - MoneyBird, Exact Online, Twinfield, etc.
   - Software calculates and submits automatically

### Information Needed

For each period, report:
- **Omzet (Revenue)**:
  - Revenue at 21% rate
  - Revenue at 9% rate
  - Revenue at 0% rate (exports)
  - EU intra-community supplies
- **Voorbelasting (Input VAT)**:
  - BTW paid on business expenses
  - BTW paid on business investments

### BTW Calculation Example

```
REVENUE SIDE (BTW Collected):
Services provided: €10,000
BTW charged (21%): €2,100
Total invoiced: €12,100

EXPENSE SIDE (BTW Paid):
Office supplies: €500 + €105 BTW = €605
Computer: €1,000 + €210 BTW = €1,210
Total BTW paid: €315

BTW TO PAY/RECEIVE:
BTW collected: €2,100
BTW deductible: -€315
Amount to pay: €1,785
```

## Payment

### Payment Deadline
- **Same as filing deadline**
- Automatic debit (automatische incasso) recommended
- Can also pay manually via online banking

### Late Payment
- **Penalty**: Vergrijpboete (fine)
- **Interest**: Belastingrente (tax interest)
- Both applied automatically if late

## Common Scenarios

### Freelancer/ZZP Standard Setup
- **Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Rate**: Usually 21% on services
- **Deadlines**: Apr 30, Jul 31, Oct 31, Jan 31

### Mixed Rate Business
Example: Café/restaurant
- Food to-go: 9%
- Dine-in food: 9%
- Alcohol: 21%
- Must track separately

### International Transactions

**Selling to EU Business (B2B):**
- 0% BTW (reverse charge)
- Require valid EU VAT number
- Report in separate section

**Selling to EU Consumer (B2C):**
- Dutch 21% BTW if under threshold
- Destination country VAT if over threshold

**Selling Outside EU:**
- 0% BTW (export)
- Keep proof of export

## Provisional Assessments

If you're new or have irregular income:
- Belastingdienst may issue provisional BTW assessments
- Pay these to avoid large year-end payments
- Adjusted when actual returns filed

## Record Keeping

### Required Documentation
- **Invoices issued** (copies of all sales invoices)
- **Invoices received** (all purchase invoices)
- **Bank statements** (proof of payments)
- **Cash register reports** (if applicable)

### Retention Period
- **7 years** minimum
- Both digital and paper accepted
- Must be available for inspection

## BTW Number

### Format
- NL + 9 digits + B + 2 digits
- Example: NL123456789B01

### Validation
Always verify customer BTW numbers:
- [VIES VAT Number Validation](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/)
- Required for 0% intra-EU supplies

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Missing filing deadline (automatic fines)
- ❌ Not keeping proper invoice records
- ❌ Claiming private expenses as business BTW
- ❌ Wrong rate applied (9% vs 21%)
- ❌ Forgetting to charge BTW to customers
- ❌ Not validating EU customer VAT numbers

## Tips for Smooth Filing

✅ **Set aside BTW immediately**: Don't spend the BTW you collect
✅ **Use accounting software**: Automates calculations and deadlines
✅ **Create BTW savings account**: Transfer collected BTW there
✅ **Enable auto-debit**: Never miss payment deadline
✅ **Review before submitting**: Common mistakes are costly
✅ **File early**: Don't wait until last day
