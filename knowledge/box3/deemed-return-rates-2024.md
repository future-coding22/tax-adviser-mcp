# Box 3 Deemed Return Rates for 2024

## Summary

Box 3 taxes wealth above the exemption threshold using deemed returns based on actual historical returns for savings vs investments. The system distinguishes between bank savings and other assets (investments, property, crypto).

## Key Information

### Exemption Amount (2024)
- **Single**: €57,000
- **With tax partner**: €114,000

### Deemed Return Calculation

The deemed return is calculated using two categories:

| Asset Category | Deemed Return Rate |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Savings** (bank deposits, saving accounts) | 1.03% |
| **Other assets** (stocks, bonds, ETFs, crypto, property) | 6.04% |

### Tax Rate

Flat rate of **32%** applied to the deemed return (not the assets themselves).

## Calculation Example

For €100,000 in total assets (€50,000 savings, €50,000 investments):

```
1. Total assets: €100,000
2. Exemption: -€57,000
3. Taxable base: €43,000

4. Split taxable base (50/50 in this example):
   - Savings portion: €21,500 × 1.03% = €221.45
   - Investment portion: €21,500 × 6.04% = €1,298.60

5. Total deemed return: €1,520.05

6. Tax due: €1,520.05 × 32% = €486.42
```

## Important Notes

### Asset Classification

**Savings category:**
- Savings accounts (spaarrekening)
- Checking accounts (betaalrekening)
- Deposits (deposito's)

**Other assets category:**
- Stocks and shares (aandelen)
- Bonds (obligaties)
- ETFs and mutual funds
- Cryptocurrency
- Investment property (not primary residence)
- Second homes

### Box 3 Legal Challenges

⚠️ **Important**: Box 3 is currently under legal review due to the "Kerstarrest" (Christmas ruling). The deemed return system may not reflect actual returns for all taxpayers.

- You may be eligible for "rechtsherstel" (legal remedy)
- Claims can be submitted for actual lower returns
- Consult Belastingdienst or tax advisor for refund possibilities

### Changes from Previous Years

| Year | Exemption (Single) | Savings Rate | Investment Rate |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 2022 | €50,650 | 0.01% | 5.69% |
| 2023 | €50,650 | 0.92% | 6.17% |
| **2024** | **€57,000** | **1.03%** | **6.04%** |

Key changes:
- Exemption increased by €6,350 (12.5% increase)
- Savings rate increased from 0.92% to 1.03%
- Investment rate decreased slightly from 6.17% to 6.04%

## Debts Deduction

Debts are deductible from your Box 3 assets:

**Deductible debts:**
- Study loans (DUO)
- Personal loans
- Investment loans
- Mortgage on non-primary residence (vacation home)

**Not deductible:**
- Mortgage on primary residence (this goes in Box 1)

## Reporting Requirements

### What to Report

You must report the **value on January 1st** of the tax year:
- Bank account balances (snapshot on Jan 1)
- Investment portfolio value
- Crypto wallet balances (converted to EUR)
- Property appraisal value

### Threshold

If your total assets are below €57,000 (€114,000 for partners), you don't need to report Box 3 at all.

## Planning Opportunities

### Strategies to Consider

1. **Utilize Full Exemption**: Ensure you're claiming your full €57,000 exemption
2. **Partner Optimization**: Split assets with partner to maximize double exemption
3. **Debt Timing**: Consider debt structure (deductible vs non-deductible)
4. **Green Investments**: Some green investments may qualify for exemptions
5. **Charitable Donations**: Not Box 3 deductible, but reduces Box 1 income

### Common Mistakes

- ❌ Forgetting to deduct student loans or other qualifying debts
- ❌ Using December 31 values instead of January 1
- ❌ Not claiming partner exemption when applicable
- ❌ Miscategorizing savings vs investments
