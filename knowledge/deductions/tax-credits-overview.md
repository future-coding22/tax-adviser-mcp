# Dutch Tax Credits Overview 2024

## Summary

**Tax credits** (heffingskortingen) directly reduce the amount of tax you pay. Unlike deductions which reduce taxable income, credits are subtracted after tax is calculated, making them more valuable euro-for-euro.

## How Credits Work

```
Gross income: €50,000
Tax calculated: €18,485 (at 36.97%)
Tax credits: -€6,983
Actual tax owed: €11,502
```

## Main Tax Credits (2024)

### 1. General Tax Credit (Algemene heffingskorting)

**Everyone** who files a tax return gets this:

| Income Level | Credit Amount |
|--------------|---------------|
| Up to €24,812 | **€3,362** (full) |
| €24,812 - €79,952 | Reduced by 6.095% per euro above €24,812 |
| €79,952+ | €0 |

#### Calculation Example

```
Income €40,000:
Base credit: €3,362
Reduction: (€40,000 - €24,812) × 6.095% = €926
Final credit: €3,362 - €926 = €2,436
```

#### Phase-Out Table

| Income | General Credit |
|--------|----------------|
| €20,000 | €3,362 |
| €30,000 | €3,045 |
| €40,000 | €2,436 |
| €50,000 | €1,827 |
| €60,000 | €1,217 |

### 2. Labor Tax Credit (Arbeidskorting)

For **working income** (employment, self-employment):

| Income Range | Credit Calculation |
|--------------|-------------------|
| €0 - €11,491 | 8.231% of income |
| €11,491 - €24,821 | €946 + 31.732% of excess over €11,491 |
| €24,821 - €38,441 | €5,052 (maximum) |
| €38,441 - €124,934 | €5,052 - 6.51% of excess |
| €124,934+ | €0 |

#### Examples

```
Income €15,000:
First €11,491: €946
Remaining €3,509: €3,509 × 31.732% = €1,113
Total: €2,059

Income €35,000:

```

## Combined Credits Example

**Scenario**: 40-year-old single parent, €35,000 income

```
Income: €35,000
Tax before credits: €12,940

Credits:
- General credit: €2,823
- Labor credit: €5,052
- Single parent credit: €1,551
- Combination credit: €2,547
Total credits: €11,973

Final tax: €12,940 - €11,973 = €967

Effective tax rate: 2.8%!
```

## Credits vs Deductions

### Tax Credit
- Directly reduces tax owed
- Worth same at any income level
- €1,000 credit = €1,000 less tax

### Tax Deduction
- Reduces taxable income
- Value depends on tax bracket
- €1,000 deduction = €370-€495 less tax (depending on bracket)

**Credits are more valuable!**

## Automatic vs Manual

### Automatic (No Action Needed)
- ✅ General tax credit
- ✅ Labor tax credit
- ✅ Elderly tax credit (if eligible)

### Must Claim
- ⚠️ Single parent credit (check box in return)
- ⚠️ Combination credit (apply separately)
- ⚠️ Some other specialized credits

## Non-Refundable

Tax credits can only reduce tax to **€0**:

```
Tax calculated: €2,000
Credits: €5,000
Tax owed: €0 (not -€3,000 refund)
```

Exception: If withholding tax was paid, you get that refunded.

## Historical Changes (2022-2024)

### General Credit

| Year | Maximum | Phase-out Start |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| 2022 | €2,888 | €21,317 |
| 2023 | €3,070 | €22,660 |
| 2024 | €3,362 | €24,812 |

### Labor Credit

| Year | Maximum |
|------|---------|
| 2022 | €4,260 |
| 2023 | €4,205 |
| 2024 | €5,052 |

**Trend**: Labor credit increased significantly in 2024 to stimulate work.

## Special Cases

### Partners
Each partner gets individual credits based on their own income.

### Part-Year Residency
Credits are pro-rated for partial year residents.

### Multiple Jobs
Credits applied once across all income sources.

## Planning Opportunities

### Income Splitting (Partners)
- Optimize who earns what
- Maximize combined credits
- Especially useful for combination credit

### Timing Income
- Consider credits when timing bonuses
- Self-employed: manage profit timing
- Stay below phase-out thresholds if possible

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Forgetting to claim single parent credit
- ❌ Not applying for combination credit
- ❌ Thinking credits increase with deductions
- ❌ Not optimizing partner income split
